However, they changed the license of TinyMCE 7 to GPLv2+ (or a commercial license) while it has been MIT for TinyMCE 6 and LGPL for older versions. This creates problems for users (see the discussion) so a fork has been created here. It has originally been named HugeMCE, however, due to potential trademark confusion with TinyMCE, it has been renamed to HugeRTE before its publishment to npm."]},{"l":"Get started with HugeRTE","p":["The simplest way to get started with HugeRTE is using a CDN:","Or install it manually via npm:","We're soon going to host the docs for HugeRTE on our website; for now, please refer to the TinyMCE docs, but replace tinymce by hugerte in all code snippets.","See this guide also, but replace tinymce@^6 by hugerte@^1(and of course, all occurrences of tinymce by hugerte).","HugeRTE provides a range of configuration options that allow you to integrate it into your application. Start customizing with a basic setup.","Configure it for one of three modes of editing:","classic editing mode.","inline editing mode.","distraction-free editing mode."]},{"l":"Migrate from TinyMCE","p":["If you have been using TinyMCE before, you have to brute-force replace tinymce by hugerte in your code.

Due to its flexibility, you can configure the editor with as much or as little functionality as you like, depending on your requirements.","With 30 powerful plugins available, and content editable as the basis of HugeRTE, adding additional functionality is as simple as including a single line of code.","Realizing the full power of most plugins requires only a few lines more."]},{"l":"Extensibility","p":["Sometimes your editor requirements can be quite unique, and you need the freedom and flexibility to innovate. Thanks to HugeRTE being open source, you can view the source code and develop your own extensions for custom functionality to meet your own requirements.","The HugeRTE API is exposed to make it easier for you to write custom functionality that fits within the existing framework of HugeRTE UI components. Just don't forget to replace every instance of the tinymce object in the TinyMCE docs by hugerte."]},{"l":"Compiling and contributing","p":["In 2019 TinyMCE made the decision to transition their codebase to a monorepo.
